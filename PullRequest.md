# Pull Request Progress

## Commit: 468e7be - feat: add .gitignore for Node.js build artifacts

Created comprehensive .gitignore file that excludes:
- Node.js dependencies (node_modules/)
- Build output directories (dist/, build/, out/)  
- Environment files (.env variants)
- TypeScript build info
- Logs and temporary files
- IDE and OS generated files

This establishes proper version control hygiene for the Node.js/TypeScript project and supports the build workflow requirements by excluding the dist directory where compiled JavaScript will be output.

## Commit: 8a61c3b - feat: add TypeScript configuration for Node.js environment

Created tsconfig.json with Node.js-optimized settings:
- Target ES2022 with CommonJS modules for Node.js compatibility
- Source files in `src/` directory, output to `dist/` directory
- Strict type checking enabled with additional safety checks
- Source maps and declaration files for debugging and library usage
- Incremental compilation for faster builds
- Excludes test files from compilation

This configuration supports both the build workflow (tsc outputs to dist/) and development workflow requirements with proper TypeScript compilation settings.

## Commit: d6e2eae - feat: initialize package.json with Express and TypeScript setup

Created package.json with complete development setup:
- Express.js as main dependency for API server
- TypeScript toolchain with ts-node-dev for hot reload development
- Jest testing framework with ts-jest preset and multiple test script variants
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Essential npm scripts including:
  - `npm run build` - compiles TypeScript to dist/ directory (satisfies ac-008)
  - `npm run dev` - starts development server with hot reload using ts-node-dev (satisfies ac-007)
  - Complete test suite scripts for unit, integration, and e2e testing
  - Linting and formatting scripts

The package configuration directly fulfills the acceptance criteria by providing both build compilation to dist/ and development server with hot reload capabilities.

## Commit: ba1dce7 - feat: create Express server with configurable port

Implemented ExpressServer class with complete port configuration and logging:
- Configurable port via PORT environment variable with 3000 default (satisfies ac-001)
- Startup logging that displays the listening port (satisfies ac-002)
- Clean server lifecycle management with start() and stop() methods
- Comprehensive Jest test suite covering all acceptance criteria:
  - test-001: Verifies server starts on PORT environment variable when set ✓
  - test-002: Verifies server defaults to port 3000 when PORT not set ✓  
  - test-003: Verifies startup message logs with port number ✓

Added Jest configuration and verified all tests pass. The implementation fulfills all specified acceptance criteria with proper TypeScript typing and error handling.
